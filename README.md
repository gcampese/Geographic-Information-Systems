# Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

This repository serves as a knowledge base for my GIS research. The majority of research is conducted using ArcGIS.
Most of the final deliverables may be described as maps generated from ArcGIS, backed by several GIS methodologies including importing and manipulating spatial data, buffering, clipping, cropping, filtering, and more!
